Understanding utilization of existing space resources across the University of North Carolina Wilmingtons (UNCW) campus has 
applications in long-term, short-term and
real-time emergency needs. This information can be used to support plans for upgrades
and expansions of the physical plant, as well as assist in the scheduling of classesunder
